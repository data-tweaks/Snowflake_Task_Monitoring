# Snowflake_Task_Monitoring
This app is actually a native app on Snowflake. As an individual, not a company, unfortunately I can not share the app on Marketplace outside of my organization. So i decided to share the app on Streamlit through GIT. 

Please run the app with a role that has the privileges to:
  - Access account_usage views on snowflake database, Account_Usage schema  
  - Monitor warehouses you run the tasks you want to analyze 
      description: "To manage warehouses for optimizing the efficiency of your accounts"
